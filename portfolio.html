    <h2>Why a butterfly?.....</h2>
    <p>Usually, butterflies are  a representation of deep and powerful presentations of life. Many cultures associate butterflies with souls. Around the world, people view butterflies as representing endurance,hope, change and life.</p>
    <p>Well as for me, more or less the same thing but with an element of freedom.</p>
    <p>This is where by people are free to express their beliefs, beauty and cultures in different ways without any judgement whatsoever.</p>
    <p>This in my opinion is represented by the different patterns and colours on their wings.</p>
