    </ul>

    <p>Furthermore i've recently added coding to the list of one of my favourite things to do.</p>
    <p>It was a bit challenging at first but now is really enjoyable especially when one gets the hang of things.</p>
    <p>Moreover during my free time, I like doing community projects such as; going to assist in children homes and also plantng trees to save the environment</p>
