   <h1>Man's bestfriend; The dog</h1>


   <p>It is believed that man's most faithful and loyal friend is the dog.</p>
   <p>As you can guess, my pet is obviously  dog. His name is Coco.</p>
   <p>He is a golden retriever.</p>
   <p>His favourite toy is a chew-toy which is in the shape of a bone.</p>

   <p>Coco is actually 5 years old which is a striking 40 years in dog years!</p>
   <p>The age of a dog actually varies due to the type of breed and its size.</p>
   <p>During his stay with us Coco has been very strong and healthy since birth due to the frequent visits to the vet.</p>
   <p>He was vaccinated against diseases such as; Canine distemper and canine parovirus which can be fatal.</p>
   <p>He feeds regularly on meat,bones and dog food.</p>
   <p>Just as a human baby requires food and care, so does a dog.</p>
