  <h1>LIFE THROUGH A LENS</h1>
  </div>
    <p>For most people a camera might just be an ordinary machine or object used for fun and taking photos and videos.</p>
    <p>Technically, they are not wrong, but in my opinon there's more to a camera than just a "machine" or an "ordinary object"</p>
    <p>To me a camera is like a magical portal to another dimension. Through a lens, there's a differnt world which lies out there.</p>
    <p>The peace that the world brings is unimagineable. It's as if your third eye has been opened to view the world differently</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the camera does not only take photos and videos but also lots of memories</p>
    <p>Photos can differ from each other. They include:</p>
